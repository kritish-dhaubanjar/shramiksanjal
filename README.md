# ShramikSanjal


Shramik Sanjal (SS), is a membership-based a worker-led network of migrant workers, most of whom are low-income migrants in the Gulf states and Malaysia. We are a voluntary network that aspires to be the voice of the voiceless, working for the well-being of fellow migrant workers. We work closely to educate, empower, and support migrant workers and advocates for their right to live with dignity and work in a decent and safe condition.
